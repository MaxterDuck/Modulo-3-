# 🛒 Product Management Project with JavaScript and JSON Server
In this project, you’ll learn how to simulate an API using a local server and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using modern JavaScript with the Fetch API.
It’s designed for beginners, so all steps are explained from scratch.

## 📦 What does this project do?
- Simulates a local server that stores product data.

- Allows you to read, create, update, and delete products.

- Everything runs with plain JavaScript and the terminal.

## 🔧 Prerequisites
You need to have the following installed:

## 1. Node.js and npm
You can check if you have them with the following command:
```js
node -v

npm -v
```
If not, download them from: https://nodejs.org/

## 2. JSON Server
Install JSON Server globally with the following command:
```js
npm install -g json-server
```

🚀 How to run the project step-by-step
## Step 1: Go to the project folder
From the terminal (Ubuntu, WSL, or CMD on Windows):

cd ~/Modulo_3/Semana_2

Make sure you're in the folder where db.json and the scripts are located.

## Step 2: Start the server
Run this command to start the server, using db.json as a mock database:
```js
json-server --watch db.json
```

🔁 Leave this command running in the terminal so the server stays active.

## Step 3: Open a new terminal to run scripts
While the server is running, open a new terminal and go to the same project folder.

From that terminal, you can run the following scripts:

## Manage products (view, add, edit, delete):(Command)
```js
node gestion_api.js
```
## Reset the database to original products: (Command)
```js
node reset_db.js
```
## 📄 Content of reset_db.js
This file overwrites the contents of db.json with the base products:


```js
const fs = require('fs');

const initialData = {
  products: [
    { id: 1, name: "Laptop", price: 1200 },
    { id: 2, name: "Mouse", price: 25 },
    { id: 3, name: "Keyboard", price: 45 }
  ]
};

fs.writeFile('db.json', JSON.stringify(initialData, null, 2), (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("❌ Error resetting database:", err);
  } else {
    console.log("✅ Database successfully reset.");
  }
});
```


💡 Important Notes Do not close the terminal where json-server is running.
You can visit http://localhost:3000/products in your browser to view products in JSON format. Or in case its port is not port 3000 you would have to change it to your port Every time you manually edit db.json, save the file and update your browser to see the changes.
